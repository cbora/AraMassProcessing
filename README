Welcome to the directory of Ara mass processing system
wiki page: http://ara.physics.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/Processing_System


OVERVIEW:

- run.pl - Top script to start the the system (./run.pl -h for help)

- setEnv_3.3.sh - for AraRoot version 3.3

- setEnv_1.7.sh - for AraRoot version 1.7

- setEnv_1.6.sh - for AraRoot version 1.6
  (User is able to source own AraRoot setup script)

- Framework/ directory contains all working codes: scripts and condor job file

- UserCode/ directory to contain the user's analysis executable and necessary files used by user's analysis ( e.g. header files)

  - UserCode/config.pm : configuration script (it is very short and has enough comments)
  
  - UserCode/RootExe : should contain all analysis executable to analyze root like file
    		     - Name the root script "RootScript.C"
		     - with an entrance function "RootScript(char * inFileName, char * outFileName, char * outNonRootFile) "

  - UserCode/RootExe/compile.C : script to be used if user's analysis needs to be compiled


  - UserCode/RawExe : should contain executable to be used in the processing of raw data file
    		    - process.sh : script to be used to call the user's binary file (there are enough comments in the process.sh script to guide the user)
		    - package assumes the user has already compiled the executable and its already in a binary format
		    - The binary should be in this same directory, and called in process.sh
		    
		    - -FROM & -TO flags in the command argument take "run_XXXX" -to "-runXXXX"
 


- Data/ : Default location to contain all output files, contains job description files, logs (main, physics, system) and results of the processing
  	- Data/Results/ should contain all output root files
  	- Data/Results/NonRootOutput should contain non root output files 


USAGE:

- Make sure you are running the system from NPX4 machine. 
       - First ssh to pub.icecube.wisc.edu, 
       - then ssh to npx4
       - possible to run it on BC GLOW
       	 -ssh to skua.icecube.wisc.edu in this case
  
- Modify config.pm to meet your needed configurations

- source setEnv_?.?.sh - to set up environmnt for your desired AraRoot version

- To start the system run 
     	   ./run.pl -dir ... -from ... -to ... -email ... -asyn (./run.pl -h for help)
   
- RUNNING ROOT FILES
     The command line argument should look something like this
     	" ./run.pl -dir /data/exp/ARA/2011/filtered/L0/ -from runXXXXX.root -to runYYYYY.root -email borachristian@email.com -asyn " 

- RUNNING RAW FILES
  	  The command line argument should look something like this
	  " ./run.pl -dir /data/exp/ARA/2011/minbias/SPS-ARA/Testbed_2011/event -from run_001000 -to run_001002 -email borachristian@gmail.com -asyn"
